## BUG-1 (HIGH) — Stray top-level `}` spun the parser into an OOM hang

**What.** A stray `}` at file level made `Parser::file()` loop forever, pushing
the same diagnostic until memory was exhausted (observed: a ~6 GiB allocation
abort). It was not a stack overflow but an **unbounded heap-growing loop** — the
process hung and then died.

**Cause.** `file()`'s recovery for an unexpected token called
`sync_to_newline()`, which **returns at `}` without consuming it** (`}` is a
block terminator inside items, not skippable trivia). A `}` is never valid at
file level, so `file()` re-read the same token every iteration and never made
progress. Unbalanced braces left by error recovery inside a module (e.g. a
malformed block whose `{` got skipped) orphan a `}` and trigger this.

**How found.** A new parser test triggered it while developing the grammar
engine; the backtrace showed `file()` repeatedly calling `Parser::error`
(growing the `Vec<Diag>`). An integration test had been masking it — the binary
OOM-crashed with a non-zero exit, which the test misread as "errored cleanly".

**Severity.** HIGH — denial of service (hang + OOM) reachable from malformed
input.

**Fix.** `file()` now bumps a stray `}` directly (rather than relying on
`sync_to_newline`), guaranteeing forward progress every iteration
(`src/parser/items.rs`).

**Test.** `stray_top_level_brace_does_not_hang` (`src/parser/tests.rs`) asserts
a stray `}` yields E1102 and terminates.

**Note.** Found and fixed during the Phase 1.8 grammar-engine work (commit
`e519690`); recorded here because it is the same input-robustness class that
motivated the full audit, and it shares the "must always make progress" lesson
with the `MAX_DEPTH` and overflow fixes in [`security.md`](security.md).
