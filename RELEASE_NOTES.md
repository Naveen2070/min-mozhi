The first public release of **Min-Mozhi (மின்மொழி)** — a modern, safe-by-default
HDL, built to teach digital design, and the first Tamil-rooted one. It reads like
Go/TypeScript, is safe like Rust, and speaks English, Tanglish, and Tamil from one
grammar — native Tamil to reach Tamil-speaking learners and to grow Tamil-rooted
programming.

**Language edition:** Wingless Butterfly (`wingless-butterfly-2026-1`).

## Highlights

- **Safety by construction** — mandatory reset values, lossless arithmetic by
  default, exhaustive `match`, single-driver and clock-domain checks, with
  teaching-quality diagnostics. (Compile-time _security_ checks — `secret` flow,
  fail-secure faults — are a design goal on the roadmap, post-v0.1.0.)
- **RTL parity batch** — replication `{N{x}}`, don't-care `match` patterns
  (`0b1??`), falling-edge blocks (`on fall(clk)`), memories (`mem`), and
  asynchronous reset (`async reset`).
- **Built-in simulator** — `mimz sim` / `mimz test` run an in-house cycle-based
  engine, validated bit-for-bit against Icarus Verilog.
- **Trilingual keywords** — write the same circuit in English, Tanglish, or Tamil
  (or mix them); every flavor compiles to byte-identical Verilog-2005.
- **Versioning model** — two clear axes: the compiler version and the language
  edition (`mimz --version` shows both).
